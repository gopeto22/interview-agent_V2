# TalentSync â€“ Project Overview & Feature Specification

## 1. Introduction

TalentSync is an end-to-end AI-powered interview simulation platform that helps candidates practice and improve their technical interviewing skills, while supplying recruiters with rich, data-driven candidate insights. The platform's mission is to enable personalized, adaptive mock interviews and generate actionable feedback, creating a structured pipeline of interview-ready candidates. With virtual interviews becoming commonplace (over 60% of HR professionals use video interviews), TalentSync leverages modern AI (including large language models and speech-AI) to deliver an interview experience that mirrors real-world hiring processes.

**Key Goals:** Provide domain-specific interview modules (e.g. Software Eng, ML, DevOps, etc.) and a resume-driven mode. Use adaptive AI to tailor questions on-the-fly based on candidate profile and answers. Offer a polished browser-based audio/video interview interface. Generate automated transcripts, scoring, and narrative feedback so users can track and improve their performance.

## 2. Core Features & Workflow

### 2.1 User Journey Overview

The typical TalentSync workflow follows these steps:

- **Sign Up / Login:** Candidates create an account or sign in.
- **Dashboard / Home:** The user sees a dashboard listing available interview modules, organized by domain and filterable by difficulty, duration, mode, etc.
- **Module Selection:** The candidate selects one of eight core domains (e.g. Software Engineering, DevOps/Kubernetes, DSA, ML/AI Engineering, Large Language Models, or a Resume-Driven interview). Each module has a detailed card showing metadata and a "Start" button.
- **Onboarding Lobby:** Before the interview, the user is guided through an onboarding lobby. This includes uploading a resume (if using the resume-driven module), checking camera/microphone settings with live preview, and reviewing interview tips.
- **Interview Session:** The user joins a real-time interview room. A live video and audio feed connects the candidate with the AI interviewer. The AI poses adaptive questions, and the candidate answers verbally. The system records the session (video/audio).
- **Post-Interview Report:** After the interview, the platform automatically generates a report. This includes a full transcript of the session, multi-dimensional scoring (correctness, completeness, fluency, etc.), percentile rankings against historical data, and an AI-crafted narrative feedback.
- **Profile & History:** The candidate can revisit their profile to see past interview reports, listen to recordings, view scores/feedback, and retake practice interviews as desired. Account settings allow updating personal info and managing privacy consents.

### 2.2 Feature Breakdown

#### Feature 1: Dynamic Interview Module Library

**Purpose:** Provide a centralized, categorized library of interview scenarios covering different technical domains.

**Components:**
- **Domain Modules:** Eight core categories (Software Eng, DevOps/Kubernetes, DSA, ML, AI Eng, LLMs, and Resume-Driven, etc.), each containing multiple question sets.
- **Card-Based UI:** Each module is presented as a responsive card in a grid layout. Cards display module title, domain icon, estimated duration, and difficulty.
- **Filtering & Search:** Users can filter modules by domain, difficulty level (easy/medium/hard), duration, or keywords via a search box. This ensures quick discovery of the most relevant practice interviews.

**Workflow:** On page load, the frontend calls `GET /api/modules` to retrieve the list of available modules. Modules are displayed as interactive cards. When a user clicks "Details", a modal or detail page shows a summary; clicking "Start" begins the interview setup.

#### Feature 2: Advanced AI Interviewer Logic

**Purpose:** Create a realistic, adaptive Q&A experience using AI. The interviewer logic personalizes questions based on the candidate's profile (including resume) and prior answers.

**Components:**
- **Resume-Driven Q&A:** If the user uploads a resume, the system uses NLP/LLM analysis to extract skills, projects, and experiences. The AI then generates or prioritizes questions tailored to that resume content, making the practice interview highly relevant.
- **Adaptive Question Engine:** A core AI engine manages question flow. Initially it seeds a queue of base questions for the chosen module (core questions + any resume-based questions). After each candidate answer, the AI transcribes and analyzes it (via speech-to-text and NLP). It then determines the next question using semantic similarity and contextual templates. Follow-up questions adapt to what the candidate has said, simulating an interviewer adjusting based on responses.
- **Interview Modes:** TalentSync supports multiple modes:
  - **Practice Mode (private):** For individual use, casual tone, instant feedback.
  - **General (formal):** Simulates a formal interview setting with stricter scoring.
  - **Invite-only:** The candidate is given a code to join a private session, possibly matching an employer or coaching session.

**Workflow:** On start, the Resume Service extracts key entities (skills, roles) from any uploaded resume. The Interview Service then uses this data to select or generate pertinent questions. During the session, each spoken answer is sent to Groq's Whisper-Large-V3 for high-accuracy speech recognition to get a text transcript. The AI extracts keywords or embeddings from the answer and uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) process or question template matching to decide on the next question. In effect, the question pipeline continuously adapts based on the candidate's input.

(Research shows LLMs can effectively emulate human interviewers, yielding quality interactions comparable to human-led interviews.)

#### Feature 3: Real-Time Audio/Video Interface

**Purpose:** Deliver a professional, browser-based live interview experience.

**Components:**
- **Onboarding Lobby:** Implements `getUserMedia` and `navigator.enumerateDevices` to let users select camera/mic. A live video preview is shown, and sound levels can be checked. The user also sees key interview tips or guidelines on-screen.
- **Interview Room:** A `<video>` element displays either the user's own feed or, for avatar-based systems, a generic interview avatar. A separate area shows the current question text. A visible timer counts down the time to answer, and a recording indicator shows that the session is being saved. The UI remains clean and stable throughout the interview.
- **Robustness:** The system handles errors smoothly: if a camera or mic disconnects, a reconnect prompt appears. Timeouts or network issues are managed by automatically retrying or asking the user to select alternate devices.

**Workflow:** Once the candidate confirms device settings in the lobby, clicking "Proceed" transitions to the Interview Room. The application starts MediaRecorder or similar APIs in the background to record audio (and optionally video) streams. The frontend continuously streams audio to the backend for real-time ASR (speech-to-text), while questions and AI responses are generated on-the-fly.

#### Feature 4: Comprehensive Performance Analytics & Feedback

**Purpose:** Provide data-driven insights post-interview, so users learn from their practice and see concrete areas for improvement.

**Components:**
- **Automated Transcription:** The audio recording is sent to Groq's Whisper-Large-V3 transcription service to produce a high-quality, punctuated transcript with speaker labels. Groq's optimized Whisper model achieves near-human accuracy on interview speech and even inserts correct punctuation and paragraph breaks with superior performance.
- **Scoring Metrics:** Each answer is scored on multiple dimensions: Correctness (semantic similarity to model answers or expert key points), Completeness (did the answer cover major points of the question?), Fluency (speech rate, word-per-minute, use of filler words like "um/uh"), and Depth (variety of concepts, examples, or follow-up discussion). These metrics use a mix of NLP (embedding similarity, named-entity matching) and audio analysis (pause detection, filler counting).
- **Percentile Ranking:** Candidate performance is contextualized by comparing metrics against the database of all past interviewees (anonymized). For example, if a candidate's fluency score is higher than 85% of others, the report shows a 85th percentile ranking. This motivates improvement by giving users a benchmark of how they stack up.
- **AI-Generated Feedback:** A large language model crafts a natural-language summary of strengths and weaknesses. It might highlight, for instance, "Your answer on X was well-structured and covered key points (90% fluency, top 20%). However, you could improve on providing examples for your claims," etc. This narrative feedback turns raw scores into actionable advice.

**Workflow:** After the interview ends, the system runs a background job (e.g. via Celery) to process the results. The audio blob is transcribed into text with timestamps using Groq's Whisper-Large-V3. The transcript and audio are used to compute all metrics (e.g. semantic scoring, fluency measures, filler word count). The LLM-based feedback generator then reads the transcript and metrics to produce a written summary. All data (scores, percentiles, transcript, feedback) are saved to the session record. Finally, the user is notified that their report is ready. This approach mirrors top hiring platforms that use ASR and NLP to automate interview analysis.

#### Feature 5: Profile Management & History

**Purpose:** Create a central hub where candidates track their progress and manage settings.

**Components:**
- **Interview History:** On the profile page, users see a chronological list of past sessions. Each entry shows the date, module, overall score, and a link to view the full report. Users can click any past session to review the transcript, watch the recording, and read feedback.
- **Practice Retake:** For practice mode interviews, an "Retake" or "Restart" button lets the user immediately do a follow-up session on the same module to improve score, using the old session for comparison.
- **Account Settings:** Standard settings include updating email/password, and managing consent for data use. Privacy settings allow users to opt-in or out of having their data included in the aggregate benchmarking database.

**Workflow:** All interview sessions are linked to the user's account in the database. The Profile page queries these session records via `GET /api/users/:id/sessions`. Each session entry on the UI includes a summary (duration, score, etc.) and actionable buttons. The "Retake" button simply invokes the same module in practice mode, preloading any resume or settings from the original session.
