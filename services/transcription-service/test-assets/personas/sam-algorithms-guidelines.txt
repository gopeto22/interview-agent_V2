## Question Framework for DSA Domain

### Question 1: "Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray. Can you solve this efficiently?"

**Problem Analysis Phase:**

**Excellent Approach:**
- Asks clarifying questions about array size, empty arrays, and all-negative scenarios
- Identifies this as the Maximum Subarray Problem (Kadane's Algorithm)
- Explains brute force O(n²) approach first, then optimizes to O(n)
- Provides clear code with proper variable naming and comments
- Analyzes time O(n) and space O(1) complexity correctly
- Handles edge cases (empty array, all negative numbers)

**Good Approach:**
- Shows understanding of the problem and identifies some edge cases
- May start with brute force but can optimize with guidance
- Writes mostly correct code with minor issues
- Understands basic complexity analysis
- Handles most common cases correctly

**Satisfactory Approach:**
- Understands the basic problem but may miss edge cases
- Struggles with optimization or needs significant hints
- Code works for basic cases but may have bugs
- Limited complexity analysis understanding
- Basic problem-solving approach

**Poor Approach:**
- Misunderstands the problem or cannot identify approach
- Cannot implement working solution even with hints
- No awareness of time/space complexity
- Poor coding practices and unclear logic

### Question 2: "Design a data structure that supports inserting integers and finding the median of all inserted integers efficiently."

**Excellent Response Criteria:**
- Immediately recognizes this as a classic two-heap problem
- Proposes using max-heap for smaller half and min-heap for larger half
- Explains balancing strategy to maintain heap size difference ≤ 1
- Provides correct implementation with proper heap operations

- Handles edge cases (empty structure, single element)
- Discusses alternative approaches (balanced BST, sorted array) and trade-offs

**Good Response Criteria:**
- Recognizes need for efficient data structure but may need hints for heap approach
- Understands the concept once explained and can implement with guidance
- Mostly correct complexity analysis
- Handles basic cases but may miss some edge cases

**Satisfactory Response Criteria:**

**Poor Response Criteria:**
- Cannot identify appropriate data structure or approach
- No understanding of efficiency requirements
- Cannot implement working solution even with extensive hints

### Question 3: "Given a binary tree, implement an algorithm to check if it's a valid binary search tree."

**Excellent Response Criteria:**
- Recognizes multiple approaches: in-order traversal, min-max bounds, recursive validation
- Chooses bounds-based approach as most efficient and explains reasoning
- Implements clean recursive solution with proper boundary checking
- Handles edge cases (null nodes, single node, duplicate values)
- Explains time O(n) and space O(h) complexity where h is tree height
- Discusses different BST validity definitions (strict vs allowing duplicates)

**Good Response Criteria:**
- Identifies valid approach (likely in-order traversal) and implements correctly
- Shows understanding of BST properties
- Handles most cases correctly with minor implementation issues
- Basic complexity analysis

**Satisfactory Response Criteria:**
- Shows understanding of BST concept but may have flawed approach
- Implementation has bugs or doesn't handle all cases
- Limited consideration of edge cases or complexity

**Poor Response Criteria:**
- Misunderstands BST properties or validation requirements
- Cannot implement working solution
- No consideration of edge cases or efficiency

## Dynamic Programming Assessment

### Question 4: "You're climbing a staircase with n steps. You can climb either 1 or 2 steps at a time. How many distinct ways can you reach the top?"

**Excellent Response Criteria:**
- Recognizes this as classic Fibonacci-based DP problem
- Explains recursive relationship: ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)
- Implements both recursive with memoization and iterative bottom-up approaches
- Optimizes space complexity from O(n) to O(1) for iterative solution
- Handles base cases (n=0, n=1, n=2) correctly

**Good Response Criteria:**
- Identifies recursive pattern and can implement with memoization
- Shows understanding of DP concepts
