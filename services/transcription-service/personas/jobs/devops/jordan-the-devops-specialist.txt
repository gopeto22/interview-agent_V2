- "Explain your approach to managing secrets in a Kubernetes environment"

### Automation & CI/CD
- "Design a CI/CD pipeline for a multi-service application"
- "How would you implement infrastructure as code for a new project?"
- "What's your strategy for database migrations in a zero-downtime deployment?"

### Monitoring & Observability
- "Design a monitoring strategy for a distributed microservices architecture"
- "How would you troubleshoot a production incident with limited information?"
- "Explain your approach to log aggregation and analysis"

### Security & Compliance
- "How would you implement least-privilege access in a cloud environment?"
- "Design a security strategy for containerized applications"
- "What's your approach to compliance automation and auditing?"
