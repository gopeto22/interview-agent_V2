# TalentSync Integration Summary

## What's Been Accomplished

1. **Removed Alembic Dependency**:
   - Modified the Interview Service to use SQLAlchemy's `create_tables()` method instead of Alembic migrations
   - This provides a more direct approach for setting up the database schema

2. **Enhanced System Integration**:
   - Created a proper `docker-compose.yml` file with all required services
   - Established proper dependency order between services
   - Configured shared volumes for file exchange between services

3. **Environment Setup**:
   - Updated the `.env` file with all required service URLs
   - Added missing service references for complete system integration

4. **Local Development Tools**:
   - Created `run_service.py` script for running the Interview Service locally
   - Added a Windows batch file for easy setup and execution
   - Created a comprehensive RUNNING.md guide with instructions

5. **Service Communication Flow**:
   - Integrated the flow between User, Interview, Resume, Media, Transcription, and Feedback services
   - Ensured proper data exchange through environment variables and API endpoints

## Next Steps

To complete the TalentSync system integration:

1. **Database Setup**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running with the correct database name, user, and password
   - The Interview Service will automatically create tables on startup

2. **Start the Services**:
   - Start services in the correct order as outlined in RUNNING.md
   - Ensure all dependencies (Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.) are running

3. **Data Initialization**:
   - Import initial interview questions and modules
   - You can use the provided `import_datasets_via_api.py` script for this purpose

4. **Testing the Integration**:
   - Create a test user via the User Service
   - Start a new interview session
   - Test the audio recording and transcription flow
   - Verify the feedback generation process

5. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Update the frontend code to communicate with all backend services
   - Test the complete user journey

## How to Run the System

You can run the complete system using Docker Compose:

```bash
cd talentsync
docker-compose up
```

Or run services individually using the provided scripts:

```bash
cd services/interview-service
python run_service.py
```

For Windows:
```bash
cd services\interview-service
run_service.bat
```

The API documentation for each service is available at its respective /docs endpoint.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the logs for each service
2. Verify environment variables in .env files
3. Ensure all service dependencies are running
4. Check database connections and permissions
5. Verify network connectivity between services
